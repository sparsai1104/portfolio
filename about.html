    <h1>ABOUT
    <p>Hello World! I am Shubhi Parsai, a Front-End Web Developer, an Artist and a Learner. Being an artist I have found my absolute interest in web development and designing. From painting sceneries on sheet of paper to lines of code on a web page, I love combining the world of creativity to make eye-catching user friendly websites.  I believe I am a very ambitious person who loves to work on making the website work well. Working on the web is my passion as I love to work on exciting projects. This is the field I get to express my creativity. This is all about me. Thanks for interviewing me. </p>
